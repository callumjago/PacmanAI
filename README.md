# PacmanAI
This repository contains the code I wrote as part of class projects when taking AI at the University of Florida
The code is based on pacman projects from UC Berkelely. (http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html)

Multiagents allows pacman to successfully navigate a board populated with multiple ghosts, using minimax search (with alpha-beta pruning) and an evaluation function in order to make smart decisions.
